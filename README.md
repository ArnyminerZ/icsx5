Web: https://icsdroid.bitfire.at/

ICSdroid is a Android 4.0+ app to subscribe to remote iCalendar files (like
time tables of your school/university or event files of your sports team).

It will download the remote calendars with a certain (free-to-choose) interval
and synchronize them into local native read-only calendars which can then used
with your calendar app.

No data (neither login data, nor calendar data, nor statistical or usage data)
is transferred to anywhere except the chosen server. No Google Calendar or
account required.


## How to use

1. Subscribe to .ics calendars by clicking them in your browser (either http[s]://…/xxx.ics or
   webcal[s]:// URLs are supported).
2. Enter title and select a color.
3. In the ICSdroid main activity, you can set your sync interval. Single-tap existing
   calendars to edit/delete them.
4. Swipe the calendar list to force a synchronization.
